Photoshop Wireframe Version 1
------------------------------

This wireframe is the most basic concept for my portfolio.  It includes an "About Me" section at the top with a picture.  Each version also has links to the "Latest Project" and "Past Projects".  When the user clicks on these links, the page will scroll down (instead of loading a new page) to the first image of a project. The navigation bar will stay at the top of the page at all times for easy navigation.  The footer element, which contains social media links, will always be at the bottom of the page.
